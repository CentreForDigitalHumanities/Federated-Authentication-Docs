# SimpleSAML-Example-And-Documentation
This how to tries to describe the process of setting up SimpleSaml to talk to the Identity Provider of University Utrechts ITS, and subsequently setting up a PHP project to make use of the features offered by SimpleSaml. The example code is present in this repository

The how-to is published online at [https://uil-ots-labs-backoffice.github.io/SimpleSAML-Example-And-Documentation/](https://uil-ots-labs-backoffice.github.io/SimpleSAML-Example-And-Documentation/) 

The intention of this project is to use the community to add documentation and example implementations for many more langauges, which will be an ongoing project.

Do you see room for improvement in the existing documentation? Or have you used this how-to to use a library for another language? **Then join the cause!**. Clone this repository and add documentation and minimal sample code for the library you used. Or just suggest changes that you think make the existing work better. Then send in a pull request with your changes.
