This repository tries to aggregate various how-to's in the topic of setting op a
Federated authentication client to talk to the Identity Provider of University
Utrecht's ITS.

Currently we provide documentation on SAML using PHP, Python and (more
specifically) Django. We aim to include similar documentation on OpenID in the
future.

.. note::
   Did this how-to help you, but did you end up using a library not yet
   documented in this how-to, or do you want to suggest improvements?

   Then please help us by cloning this repository, creating minimal code
   examples for the used programming language or updating the how-to and create
   a pull request.
