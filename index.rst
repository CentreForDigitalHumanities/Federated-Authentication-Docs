This repository tries to aggregate various how-to's in the topic of setting op a
Federated authentication client to talk to the Identity Provider of University
Utrecht's ITS and/or SurfConnext.

Currently we provide documentation on SAML using PHP, Python and (more
specifically) Django. We aim to include similar documentation on OpenID in the
future.

.. note::
   Did this how-to help you, but did you end up using a library not yet
   documented in this how-to, or do you want to suggest improvements?

   Then please help us by cloning this repository, creating minimal code
   examples for the used programming language or updating the how-to and create
   a pull request.
